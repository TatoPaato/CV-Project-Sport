Introduction
============
The code present in the ``CODE`` folder of the repository can be divided into two groups. 

1. The ``CameraUtils`` module contains the definition of classes, methods, and functions written for the project's purpose. 

2. The Scripts:

   - ``configuration.py`` is a Python file that contains user-definable settings that influence the behavior of scripts when they are executed. This approach was chosen for ease of development, as it simplifies the process compared to using command-line arguments.

   - ``Calibration_INT.py`` is a script that, according to the configuration file:
   
     - Gets sample frames from chessboard calibration videos and saves them to file OR simply reads calibration images from file if they are already sampled.
     - Performs the intrinsic calibration of the cameras, according to the type of camera (normal or wide-lens).
     - Saves the found parameters to a ``.pkl`` file for later use.
     - Shows the effect of camera calibration by undistorting the raw images.

   - ``Calibration_EXT.py`` is a script that reads the intrinsic parameters from the ``.pkl`` files and launches the ``getCorrespondences()`` method to allow the user to identify key point correspondences between the real world and the images. Once a sufficient number of correspondences is acquired, the extrinsic calibration is performed, as well as a plane-to-plane mapping between the image and court floor.

   - ``PointsHighlighting.py`` is a simple graphical user interface to display all camera views and highlight a selected point on all views, using the plane-to-plane mapping found with the previous script.

   - ``Plotter.py`` is a utility script used to generate plots for the written report.

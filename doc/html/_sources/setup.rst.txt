.. _SetUp:

Set up the project
==================

The project was:

- developed and tested on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS.
- tested on Ubuntu 22.04.
- tested on WSL2 - Ubuntu.
.. note::
    IN WSL2, in order to display interactive plots make sure a backend such as `tk` is installed, by running::
    
        sudo apt install python3-tk


Virtual environments
--------------------
The next steps are adapted from `this guide <https://linuxgenie.net/install-pip-ubuntu-24-04/>`_.

.. warning:: 
   According to the latest changes in Debian release, and therefore Ubuntu 24.04, Python packages are not installed or managed via PIP in the external environment/globally. If you use the pip command to manage the Python packages outside the Python environment, you will get the error: **externally managed environment**. The best solution is to create a Python environment for the project and manage all the necessary packages/modules there using **pip**.


Install the ``venv`` module using ``apt``::

    sudo apt install python3-venv

Go to the folder with all the project files and create a virtual environment ``<ve_name>`` for Python and activate it using the source command::

    python3 -m venv <ve_name>
    source <ve_name>/bin/activate

You can now install the required packages by running::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

.. note:: 
   In Ubuntu 24.04, both pip and pip3 commands refer to python3-pip, as Python 2 is no longer officially supported.

**pip** can be installed globally by running::

    sudo apt install python3-pip

If everything is correctly setup, you are ready to launch the scripts.
